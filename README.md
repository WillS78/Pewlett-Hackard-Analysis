Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to build a backfill strategy for the company and help them understand how big of a project this would be and define their timeline. With the company their size and the tenure they had it was important to understand what departments and roles would be starting to open over the next three to five years. We want to make sure we’re staying proactive in our recruiting, hiring, onboarding and training to ensure no mission critical positions fell through the crack.

•	There are six departments that will be impacted with a few of them being senior and engineer levels within the organization. This is circle as these roles if not properly backfill and trained could cripple the company future.

•	When digging into the data you can see that this will impact multiple people within the same departments and teams. This is critical as the loss without a proper backfill strategy would cripple an entire department and team. Using this you can formulate which departments are the greatest risk and start hiring for those roles first.

•	Then looking at the specialized roles vs entry level will help your recruiting team build specific job descriptions, minimum requirements and start reaching out to highly qualified candidates from their competitors. This would help speed up the hiring and training timeline.

•	Utilizing your mentorship data set you then can align who would be the right person to pair with a new hire to mentor them and help the new hire get on their feet faster. In return it will reduce the impact of people retiring and the cost of training by shortening their progress timeline.
